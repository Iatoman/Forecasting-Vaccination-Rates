Data Science Project - Forecasting Vaccination Rates for H1N1 &amp; Seasonal Flu

Welcome to our project, where we explore and analyze the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey dataset to investigate the factors influencing vaccination rates. This coursework assignment entails a collaborative effort between my partner and me as we apply the comprehensive data science steps we have learned to create and compare various machine learning models. Throughout this endeavor, we aim to document our findings in a joint academic paper, meticulously examining and evaluating our results at each stage of the data analysis and modeling pathway.

Dataset Overview:
Our chosen dataset, the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey, provides valuable insights into the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine and pH1N1 vaccination coverage rates during 2009 and 2010 in the United States. Comprising 36 parameters, this dataset was meticulously compiled through a telephone survey conducted in homes. It includes a wide range of information such as knowledge, opinions, and demographic elements that have the potential to impact vaccination rates significantly. By leveraging the power of data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to unravel meaningful patterns and correlations within this dataset, shedding light on the factors that contribute to successful vaccination campaigns and the overall spread of diseases.
